# ABCQuest
Always Be Questing

This is my frontend capstone project, built with HTML, CSS, AngularJS and Firebase.  

ABCQuest is a simple game where users battle orcs for points. As the player takes damage, they can heal themselves with potions purchased by making github commits.  

The goal of the game is to defeat as many orcs as possible, log out for awhile, then log back in and take on more orcs after making more Github commits.  

ABCQuest uses your Github account to log you into your ABCQuest user account. 

Click "mine for gold!" after logging in and a prompt will pop up to ask you for the name of a Github repo. ABCQuest keeps track of your commits to each repo, and will reward you with gold- up to a total of 30 for a repo- for every commit made since last check.

As you fight orcs, you will also take damage. Click 'Health potion' to restore your HP to full at the cost of 1 GP. You will no longer be able to fight orcs if your HP reaches 0.
